Toy project for testing the precompiled shaders in OpenGL 4.6. It grew a little bit cause I wanted to explore the possibility of generating vertex array objects using the meta type description. This project uses a small meta library implementation using the idea originally designed and developed by Odin Holmes ( https://github.com/odinthenerd/tmp ). 

Verified only under clang-6.0.1 it won't compile under VS. 

This code is not a production ready code it is suppose to be just a toy project to verify few theories and ideas!
